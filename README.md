# ISLRCh.4_Classification_Weekly_data
 
Hello, in this repository I have a .ipynb file which contains some code for a classification 
statistical learning exercise. For the excercise we exam weekly stock market data. 
I split the data into trainng and testing, and then I found the significant variables. Finally 
I run some models for classification on train the training data, find the models that perform best,
and then use those to see how well they fit the test data set.
